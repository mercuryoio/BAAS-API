# Commercial-API

Mercuryo API is a set of crypto and fiat balances that allows users to quickly and easily exchange crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto, and top up and withdraw funds from fiat balance too.

If you have a crypto wallet or other crypto service, your users can create Mercuryo wallet and see an additional fiat balance in the interface. They can use Mercuryo wallet as simple as other that already exist in your servise

The Mercuryo API is structured around a your and user's wallets. Users create wallets and perform operations with them, and you monitors the transactions of these users and manages your own savings earned from each user transaction.
