# Sign in

**NEW LOGIN FLOW IS IN DEVELOPMENT. FOR MORE INFORMATION LOOK [HERE](../new-sign-in/README.md)**

***
***

For methods in `/sdk/` domain you need your `sdk-partner-token`. Ask your Mercuryo manager to get it.

***

In Mercuryo users can be registered only with phone.
Users can be authorised with phone and uuid. Uuid - uniq user id. As a partner you will get it as a response for sign-in method and we recommend to save it to user account on your side.

New users need to accept Mercuryo 'Terms and Policies'. [See Acceptance](#acceptance)

All the users need to pass KYS authorization to use their crypto-wallets or create IBAN.
*Note: US user also need verified email address to work with Mercuryo API*

We do not work with all countries. To get list of supported countries use method [`GET /lib/countries`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-Public-PublicCountries)

#### 1. Sing up

**Case:**

The customer wants to by crypto on your side. You do not have information about users phone. User have not got Mercuryo account. `accept` parameter is required.

**Steps:**

1. Ask user about phone. Please note that we don't work with some countries. You can get the list of available countries with [`GET /lib/countries`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-Public-PublicCountries)
We recommend you to design a drop-down list of phone codes using this method.

2. Use method [`POST /sdk-partner/sign-in`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-SDK-SDKLogin) to pass user's phone to Mercuryo API

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403004 | `User not found.` | wrong uuid |
| 403005 | `invalid country by phone number` |  wrong countrycode |
| 403005 | `Country %s is not active or not exist.` | country is inactive |
| 403005 | `Country %s is in black list.` | country in black list |
| 403010 | `Phone is invalid` | phone is invalid |
| 403006 | `Accept cannot be blank for new users` | there is no `acception` parameter |


4. Get verification code from user
5. Use method [`POST /sdk-partner/phone-verify`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-SDK-SDKPhone_verify) to give Mercuryo API user's phone and verification code


| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403001 | `Verification failed.` | wrong key  |
| 403002 | `Verification failed.` |  wrong code |


6. Use [`GET /b2b/user/data`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-User-UserData) to get info about user's status

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 500001 | `try later` | smth going wrong |


| Status  |  Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  |
| KYC status |  |
| `complete` | KYC is passed successfully|
| `under_review` | KYC is in progress |
| `failed` | KYC is failed |
| `incomplete`| KYC isn't passed |

3. If user status is `temporary-blocked` user will be able to use Mercuryo in 15 min.
4. If user sill has problem -- ask Mercuryo support

7. User need to pass KYC. Use method [`GET /b2b/user/kyc-access-token`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-B2B_User-UserKycAccessToken) to get user's KYC token

| Error  | Text | Description  |

Link must contains this parameters:

#### 2. Partner has phone sign-up

**Case:**

The Customer wants to by crypto on your side. You have information about users phone. User have not got Mercuryo account. `accept` parameter is required.

**Steps:**

If you have users phone there are some differences with previous case:

1. You do not need to ask user about his phone. Just transfer `phone` parameter to Mercuryo API
2. If users phone is already verificated on your side - skip phone verification

All other steps are same with previous case

***

#### 3. User from US

**Case:**

The Customer wants to by crypto on your side. User have not got Mercuryo account. User from US

How to detect that the Customer is from US:

1. Phone code is +1
2. Response on method `/b2b/user/email-verify` contains this:

| Parameter  |  Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  |
| `country_code` | `us` |

**Steps:**

US users need to verificate their e-mail too

1. Use  method [`POST /b2b/user/set-email`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-User-UserSetEmail) to send user e-mail to Mercuryo API

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403006 | `Email cannot be blank.` |  wrong e-mail |
| 403006 | `Email is not a valid email address.` | invalid e-mail |
| 403006 | `Email "ff@dd.dd" has already been taken.` | e-mail is already taken |

3. Use method [`POST /b2b/user/email-verify`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-User-UserEmailVerify) to give Mercuryo API user's phone and verification code

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403007 | `Token somehow contains invalid data.` | token data is invalid |
| 401008 | `Verification failed.` | invalid token |
| 401009 | `Verification failed.` | code is invalid |

4. Mercuryo API response with user status

***

#### 4. Log in by uuid

**Case:**

The Customer wants to by crypto on your side. User have Mercuryo account. Login by uuid. `accept` parameter isn't required becouse uuid have only already registrated users

**Steps:**

1. Use method [`POST /sdk-partner/sign-in`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-SDK-SDKLogin) to initiate login by uuid

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403004 | `User not found.` | wrong uuid |
| 400305 | `invalid country by phone number` |  wrong countrycode |
| 403005 | `Country `%s` is not active or not exist.` | country is inactive |
| 403005 | `Country `%s` is in black list.` | country in black list |
| 403005 | `Phone is invalid` | phone is invalid |
| 403005 | `Invalid uuid4` | wrong uuid format |

2. If as a responce you get user's token - you do not need to verify user's phone. If as a response you get `code length` you need to verify user's phone by method [`POST /sdk-partner/phone-verify`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-SDK-SDKPhone_verify) to give Mercuryo API user's phone and verefication code

3. Then Mercuryo API will send users status to you

***

#### 5. Log in by phone

**Case:**

The Customer wants to by crypto on your side. User have Mercuryo account. Login by phone. If you are not shure is user already registrated or not - pass `accept` parameter to Mercuryo API

**Steps:**

Flow is the same with log in by uuid but with little diffenrences:

1. Use method `POST /sdk-partner/sign-in`
2. User do not need to verificate his phone
