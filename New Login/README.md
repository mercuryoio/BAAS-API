2. Use method [`POST /b2b/user/sign-up`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-B2B-B2BSignUp) to pass Customer's e-mail and 'accept' parameter to Mercuryo API

Request:

| `b2b-bearer-token` | string | Authorisation token |


3. Get verification code from the Customer. Code will be sent to Customers e-mail by Mercuryo
4. Use method [`POST /b2b/user/verify-email`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-B2B-B2BEmail_verify) to verify Customers e-mail. 

**This is optional.** To On\Off e-mail verification ask your Mercuryo Manager.

5. The Customer needs to pass KYC 

### 2. KYC. 

#### 2.1 Passing KYC with uploading documents to the SumSub widget

In this method, the user will need to go through KYC through the web view of Mercuryo by uploading the necessary documents.

Use method [`GET /b2b/user/kyc-access-token`]() to get user's KYC token

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403004 | `User not found.` | user not found |


Then you need to redirect user to Mercuryo side by link.

Link example: `https://payments.mercuryo.io/kyc?access_token=your_token8&scheme=your_scheme&lang=lang_code`

Link must contain these parameters:

| Parameter  |  Description  | Type |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| `access_token` | your access token, you get it from method `GET /b2b/kyc-access-token` | obligatory |
| `success_url` | [how to set](https://github.com/mercuryoio/Commercial-API/blob/master/admin.md) urlencoded JSON | obligatory |
| `failure_url`  | [how to set](https://github.com/mercuryoio/Commercial-API/blob/master/admin.md) urlencoded JSON | obligatory |
| `status` | add to `failure_url` if the User taped on the back button - `status: back`, if you get an error as a response `status: fail` | obligatory |
| `msg` | string. This is an error message that you can get as a response from any api method | obligatory if `status: fail` |
| `scheme` | `dark` or `light` | optional |
| `lang` | language. By default it is `en`. Supported languages: `en`, `zh`, `ru`, `fr`, `hi` , `id`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt`, `es`, `tr`, `vi`  | optional |


#### 2.2. Passing KYC with share token


Registering with a share-token allows to eliminate repeat KYC verification. Share-token allows you to exchange KYC data between you and Mercuryo. If the user has passed KYC verification in your app using the SumSub service, you can generate share-token containing the userâ€™s data and documents with SumSub and provide it to Mercuryo.

In order to use share-token use method [`POST /b2b/user/share-token`] to make The Customer pass KYC in SumSub.

Request:

| Parameter  | Type | Description  | Obligatory |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  | -------------  |
| `shareToken` | string | Share token from Partner from You | Yes |
| `resetIdDocSetTypes` | string | Specify one or few comma-separated document types if an applicant has to resubmit those documents to be verified. Examples, SELFIE, IDENTITY, etc. | No |
| `trustReview` | boolean | If you trust your partner's check result, then you should use true. If it is false, then the applicant will be rechecked. | No |
| `userid` | string | Sets your own externalUserId for the imported applicant. In case of empty value we'll generate a random one | No |
