### 1. Sing up

**Steps:**

1. Ask the Customer about his e-mail
2. Use method [`POST /b2b/user/sign-up`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/docs/index.html#api-B2B-B2BSignIn) to pass Customer's e-mail and 'accept' parameter to Mercuryo API
3. Get verification code from the Customer. Code will be sent to Customers e-mail by Mercuryo
4. Use method [`POST /b2b/user/verify-email`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/docs/index.html#api-B2B-B2BEmail_verify) to verify Customers e-mail. 

**This is optional.** To On\Off e-mail verification ask your Mercuryo Manager.

5. The Customer needs to pass KYC 

### 2. KYC. 

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

#### 2.1 Passing KYC with uploading documents to the SumSub widget

In this method, the user will need to go through KYC through the web view of Mercuryo by uploading the necessary documents.

Use method [`GET /b2b/user/kyc-access-token`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/docs/index.html#api-B2B_User-UserKycAccessToken) to get user's KYC token

| Error  | Text | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| 403004 | `User not found.` | user not found |


Then you need to redirect user to Mercuryo side by link.

Link example: `https://payments.mercuryo.io/kyc?access_token=your_token8&scheme=your_scheme&lang=lang_code`

Link must contain these parameters:

| Parameter  |  Description  | Type |
| ------------- | -------------  | -------------  |
| `access_token` | your access token, you get it from method `GET /b2b/kyc-access-token` | obligatory |
| `success_url` | [how to set](https://github.com/mercuryoio/Commercial-API/blob/master/admin.md) urlencoded JSON | obligatory |
| `failure_url`  | [how to set](https://github.com/mercuryoio/Commercial-API/blob/master/admin.md) urlencoded JSON | obligatory |
| `status` | add to `failure_url` if the User taped on the back button - `status: back`, if you get an error as a response `status: fail` | obligatory |
| `msg` | string. This is an error message that you can get as a response from any api method | obligatory if `status: fail` |
| `scheme` | `dark` or `light` | optional |
| `lang` | language. By default it is `en`. Supported languages: `en`, `zh`, `ru`, `fr`, `hi` , `id`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt`, `es`, `tr`, `vi`  | optional |


#### 2.2. Passing KYC with share token

Registering with a share-token allows to eliminate repeat KYC verification. Share-token allows you to exchange KYC data between you and Mercuryo. If the user has passed KYC verification in your app using the SumSub service, you can generate share-token containing the userâ€™s data and documents with SumSub and provide it to Mercuryo.

In order to use share-token use method [`POST /b2b/user/share-token`] to make The Customer pass KYC in SumSub.

#### 2.3. Passing KYC with sharing verification documents with Mercuryo

Use method [`Post /b2b/user/kyc-docs`] to send Customers data and documents in pictures to Mercuryo. To make this method avaliable for you contact your Mercuryo Manager.

### 3. Sign in

To sign in the Customer use method [`GET /b2b/user/sign-in`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/docs/index.html#api-B2B-B2BSignUp). 
As input parameters you will need to pass 'sdk-partner-token' in header and `uuid` **OR** `email` **OR** `phone'.

How to get:

1. `uuid` as a response from method `POST /b2b/user/sign-up` if e-mail verification is off. Or as a response from method `POST /b2b/user/verify-email` if e-mail verification is on.
2. `email` -- from The Customer.
3. `phone` -- from The Customer.

### 4. User data

Use [`GET /b2b/user/data`](https://sandbox-cryptosaas.mrcr.io/v1.6/comm-docs/index.html#api-User-UserData) to get info about Customers's status

| Error  | Text | Description  |
